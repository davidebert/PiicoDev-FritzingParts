# PiicoDev-FritzingParts

This is a repository of Fritzing parts for PiicoDev products from Core Electronics. I am not a graphics designer nor an electrical engineer, and am not affiliated with Core Electronics, although I am a big fan of their products. I am creating these primarily to use the parts to generate graphical representations of circuits incorporating PiicoDev products, making it easier for students to follow a circuit diagram. It is not my intention to create files that could be used to make PCBs.

That said, I am happy to accept any suggestions of ways that parts can be improved, tips on how to better use InkScape for creating Fritzing parts or corrections to any misrepresentation of the parts.

This repository contains all the individual parts that I have created as will as a zipped bin (PiicoDev.fzbz), which you should be able to import directly into Fritzing. If you want to include a Core Electronics icon to identify the PiicoDev bin in Fritzing, you will need to download and save the CoreElectronicsSymbol.png to the same folder that contains the PiicoDev bin.
