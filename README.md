# PiicoDev-FritzingParts
This is a repository of Fritzing parts for PiicoDev products made by Core Electronics. I am not a graphics designer nor an electrical engineer, and am not affiliated with Core Electronics. I am creating these primarily to use the parts to generate graphical representations of circuits incorporating PiicoDev products, making it easier for students to follow a circuit diagram. It is not my intention to create files that could be used to make PCBs.

That said, I am happy to accept any suggestions of ways that parts can be improved, tips on how to better use InkScape for creating Fritzing parts or corrections to any misrepresentation of the parts.
